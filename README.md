## Keymapping:

## Hot Strings:
Shortform::FullForm is for hotstrings where shortform is changed to fullform after pressing space or tab or enter

it has many options which can be inserted between the : and : in :: which gives different effects:

```*``` (asterisk): An ending character (e.g. Space, ., or Enter) is not required to trigger the hotstring

```?``` (question mark): The hotstring will be triggered even when it is inside another word

```C```: Case sensitive: When you type an abbreviation, it must exactly match the case defined in the script. Use C0 to turn case sensitivity back off.

```o```: Omit the ending character of auto-replace hotstrings when the replacement is produced
