## Keymapping:

1)   ```;``` is line comment
2)   ```!``` is alt as a prefix
3)   ```+``` is shift as a prefix
4)   ```^``` is Ctrl as a prefix
5)   ```#``` is Window Key as a prefix

Up, Down, Left, Right refers to the arrow keys


## Hot Strings:
Shortform::FullForm is for hotstrings where shortform is changed to fullform after pressing space or tab or enter\
Here are some options that can be inserted between the : and : in :: to gives different effects:

1) ```*``` (asterisk): An ending character (e.g. Space, ., or Enter) is not required to trigger the hotstring
2) ```?``` (question mark): The hotstring will be triggered even when it is inside another word
3) ```C```: Case sensitive: When you type an abbreviation, it must match the case defined in the script. Use C0 to turn case sensitivity back off.
4) ```o```: Omit the ending character of auto-replace hotstrings when the replacement is produced
